### a minimal social media made using websockets

The reason I am putting this social media in public is for reference of how to :- <br>
- Transfer photos over a socket connection 
- keep a python websocket alive for real time chatting **Without the pings and pongs**
- and the very basic JSON manipulation<br>
And when you open the website up no posts will be seen that is due to the fact that I have ommited that part from the code solely because that part of the code is one of the most integral and hard and I want to work on it myself
