### a minimal social media made using websockets
Okay why am I puting my social media in public which is infact horrid the code is pretty downtrodden and disgusting to look at and if you don't want to experience pure hell don't even look at the javascript file it is the single most disgusting piece of code I have ever written<br>Now onto the point well it is due to the fact that I made this code without any kind of planning, I mean I had planning but that was for java, but then due to unforseen circumstances I fell in love with pointers, the C way of thinking and then it turned out that websites use websockets,freaking websockets which are encrypted now golang has websockets but they were just not working and it was hell as I had to shift to python which I kind of despised<br><br>Similarily JavaScript did not manage to disappoint satan and had weird websocket connection rules and all that trash I was just a normal java developer used to normal sockets which stay online forever and it all crashed down I mean by the end I had evolved and realised an efficient way to use all this mess but my code had become unfixable it had become true trash <br><br>
### All of that does not matters<br>
The reason I am putting this social media in public is for reference of how to :- <br>
- Transfer photos over a socket connection 
- keep a python websocket alive for real time chatting **Without the pings and pongs**
- and the very basic JSON manipulation<br><br>
now I thought at long last my goal will be complete but it was not as I still feel the lack of adequate to make the efficient product mark had made so ... yes this is gonna take some time and practice
